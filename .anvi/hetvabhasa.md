## Universal Error Patterns

### U1: Timing Error (Krama Violation)
**Root cause:** The dependent operation is async. Your code runs before it completes.
**Detection signal:** Method call has no effect, returns null/undefined, or operates on uninitialized state.
**The trap:** You see the no-op and add a retry, setTimeout, or polling loop — which works sometimes, depending on timing. The root fix is to run your code INSIDE the async callback, not after it.

### U2: Identity Error (Object Mutation Assumption)
**Root cause:** The method returns a new object. Your property is on the old one.
**Detection signal:** Property you set is missing on the object downstream in the chain.
**The trap:** You set the property again downstream, or add it to the prototype (global leak). The root fix is to tag the RETURN VALUE of the method, not the input.

### U3: Scope Error (Prototype Collision)
**Root cause:** The framework owns the prototype. Your installation runs before the framework's, and gets overwritten.
**Detection signal:** Your interceptor/wrapper is never called despite being installed.
**The trap:** You install it "harder" (non-configurable, frozen) which breaks the framework. The root fix is to install AFTER the framework, or inside its initialization hook.

### U4: Observation Error (Mock Divergence)
**Root cause:** The mock doesn't replicate the real system's transformations on inputs/outputs.
**Detection signal:** Tests pass, production fails. The specific failure involves data shape or type that the mock never tested.
**The trap:** You fix the production code to handle the unexpected shape, but the mock still doesn't test it — so regression is invisible. The root fix is to test through the real pipeline for critical paths.

### U5: Workaround Error (Symptom Suppression)
**Root cause:** The underlying system doesn't have the information it needs.
**Detection signal:** Cascading fixes — each fix creates a new symptom. "Fixed A, now B is broken. Fixed B, now C."
**The trap:** Each individual fix is small and seems reasonable. The cascade feels like bad luck. The root fix is always at the data source — give the system the information it's missing (e.g., container dimensions, correct argument type, proper initialization).

### U6: Mutation-for-Observation Error
**Root cause:** Observation requires a tap into the data flow, but you redirected the flow instead of tapping it.
**Detection signal:** The thing you're observing works, but everything else on the same data path breaks.
**The trap:** You try to "fix" the broken paths by duplicating the data, creating a fork. The root fix is a passive side-tap (read-only connection) instead of a redirect.

## Project-Specific Error Patterns

_(Add entries as discovered. Follow the format below.)_
_(At every 10th entry: review, prune stale/non-generalizable entries.)_

## P1: Under-subdivided long geometry disappears under sphere projection
**Root cause:** Sphere mode's additive vertex shader curves vertices individually, then the rasterizer linearly interpolates between them. A `BoxGeometry` (or any primitive) spanning more than ~one cube face with only the default 1 segment has no intermediate vertices — the interpolation cuts a straight CHORD through the sphere interior, landing below the global SphereGeometry terrain. The mesh is rendered but occluded everywhere. Bezier height compression at low rawHeight makes the chord dip even further below radius 1.0.
**Detection signal:** Mesh is invisible in sphere mode but renders correctly in cube/split mode. Nearby small meshes on the same y level (dashes, posts) render fine. Bumping Y higher doesn't recover it. Changing color to bright red produces zero red pixels.
**The trap:** You blame z-fighting and bump Y (doesn't fix it because the chord still dips below), or blame clip planes / material flags / depthWrite (all fine). Root fix: add enough `widthSegments` (and `depthSegments` for long z-axis spans) that the shader has vertices to curve. Rule of thumb: ≥ ~8 segments per cube-face-block the mesh spans.
**REF:** UNGROUNDED — sphere projection shader lives in-project at `src/diorama/TileGrid.tsx:370-413` (the `<project_vertex>` replacement in `patchMaterialForSphere`). Road fix at `src/diorama/buildDiorama.ts:687-697` (`BoxGeometry(BASE_W, 0.025, ROAD_WIDTH, 64, 1, 1)`).

### Entry Format (MANDATORY fields)

```
## [ID]: [Name]
**Root cause:** [What actually causes this]
**Detection signal:** [How you notice it]
**The trap:** [The wrong fix that's tempting]. Root fix: [the actual fix]
**REF:** [Ground Truth doc]#[section] — `[source_file:line]` [what the code shows]
```

The `**REF:**` field is MANDATORY for all project-specific entries. It creates the provenance chain:

```
Catalogue entry (compact pattern)
    ↓ REF: GROUND_TRUTH_*.md#stage-N
Interpretation (how/why/when + code citations)
    ↓ REF: file:line
Source code (ground truth)
```

If you cannot cite a Ground Truth doc, the entry is UNGROUNDED — mark it `**REF:** UNGROUNDED — [reason]` and prioritize grounding it by reading the relevant source code.

### Ground Truth Documents

Ground Truth docs are produced using the meta-prompt at `~/.anvideck/projects/[project]/ref/GROUND_TRUTH_META_PROMPT.md`. They trace a system's pipeline end-to-end with `file:line` citations for every behavioral claim. To create one:

1. Download the reference system's source code to `~/.anvideck/projects/[project]/ref/sources/[system_name]/`
2. Apply the meta-prompt with the source files as input
3. Output: `~/.anvideck/projects/[project]/ref/GROUND_TRUTH_[SYSTEM_NAME].md`
4. Update catalogue REF fields to point to the new doc
